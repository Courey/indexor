# indexor - A toy search engine!

Nothing is working yet. But we do have a collection of files we want to work with:

1.  Download https://www.dropbox.com/s/lv44vyl8ia46llx/sample.tar.bz2?dl=0
    and unzip it. (It creates a directory named `sample` with about 8,476
    files in it.)

2.  Run `./build_index.py` to try to build the index.
    Like we said, it doesn't work yet.
